# Todo List App 📝
> Basic Practice using react

A basic React-based Todo List application built for practice. This app allows users to add tasks, mark them as done, delete individual tasks, and mark all tasks as done at once. It uses React's `useState` for state management and `uuid` for generating unique IDs for tasks.
